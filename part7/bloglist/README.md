## Part 7 Exercises (Full Stack Open)

This directory contains the Bloglist application refactored during Part 7 of the Full Stack Open course.

### State Management Exercises (7.10 - 7.13)

Exercises 7.10 through 7.13 involved exploring different state management solutions for the frontend application. To facilitate comparison and keep the implementations isolated, these were completed on separate Git branches:

- **Redux Implementation:** Can be found on the branch: `part7-redux`
- **React Query + Context Implementation:** Can be found on the branch: `part7-react-query`

This `main` branch represents the codebase _before_ these specific state management refactors were applied (reflecting the state after Exercise 7.9 - Prettier setup).

### Subsequent Exercises (7.14+)

Further exercises in Part 7 that build upon the state management foundations (like adding new views or features) were implemented directly on the `part7-react-query` branch. Please check out the respective branches to see the solutions for those exercises.
