# Full Stack open

This repository contains my solutions and code developed while working through the exercises of the University of Helsinki's [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course.

## Repository Structure

The code in this repository is organized into folders, corresponding to the different parts of the course (e.g., `part0`, `part1`, `part2`, etc.). Each folder contains the exercises related to that part.
