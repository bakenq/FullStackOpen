# Full Stack Phonebook (Part 3 Backend & Deployment Root)

This directory contains the Node.js/Express backend API **and serves the production build** of the React frontend for the phonebook application developed during the University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course (Exercises 3.1 - 3.11 and onwards). This folder acts as the root for the deployed full-stack application.

## Live Application URL

The app is live via Render and can be accessed **[here](https://react-phonebook-ptw2.onrender.com)**:
*(This URL serves both the user interface built with React and the backend API)*

## Description
