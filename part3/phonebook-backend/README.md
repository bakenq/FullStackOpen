# Phonebook Backend (Full Stack Open - Part 3)

This directory contains the Node.js/Express backend API for the phonebook application developed as part of the University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course (Exercises 3.1 - 3.10 and onwards).

## Live Application URL

The deployed backend API is live and can be accessed **[here](https://react-phonebook-ptw2.onrender.com)**:

Note: This URL provides just the API endpoints for now.

## Description

A simple RESTful API built with Express that allows fetching, adding, and deleting phonebook entries (persons with names and numbers). It uses an in-memory array for data storage in early exercises, intended to be replaced later. Includes basic logging and CORS support.

## Related Frontend

The corresponding frontend application for this backend can be found in the `/part2/phonebook` directory of the main [FullStackOpen](https://github.com/bakenq/FullStackOpen) repository.
